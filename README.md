# StoReel
## A picture is worth a thousand words... Imagine what a gif can do.
Once upon a time, there was storytelling at Hack Harvard. We built a website that brings a story to life by displaying a sentence by sentence breakdown into images. Furthermore, we provide a single gif that describes the story, which is easily sharable, by URL, or directly from Twitter or Facebook. This easily sharable and easily made gif currency allow people to communicate in expressive and unique ways, breaking the language bareer and providing a fun outlet for creative expression
