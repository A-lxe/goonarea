# Storeel
## A picture is worth a thousand words. Imagine what a gif can do.
Once upon a time, there was storytelling at Hack Harvard. Storeel is a website that brings a story to life by turning each sentence into a tale of images, rather than just words. Furthermore, it provides a descriptive gif which is easily sharable by URL or directly on Twitter or Facebook. This easily made gif currency allows people to communicate in expressive and unique ways, breaking the language barrier and providing a fun outlet for creative expression. We open the world to a whole new level of communication and storytelling; this time the author is you. 

Using Microsoft Cognitive APIs, Storeel parses any story, poetry, news, or 200-character musings provided, and it picks out the most important parts using part-of-speech tagging and constituent analysis. Then, using the Bing Image Search API, Storeel finds the most relevant image to represent those parts, and compiles a gif of the story, free to share via Twitter or Facebook.
On top of that, options  let users customize the way Storeel reads their stories so they can peresonalize it however they like.
