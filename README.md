# StoReel
## A picture is worth a thousand words... Imagine what a gif can do.
Once upon a time, there was storytelling at Hack Harvard. We built a website that brings a story to life by displaying a sentence by sentence breakdown into images. Furthermore, we provide a descriptive gif which is easily sharable by URL or directly on Twitter or Facebook. This easily made gif currency allows people to communicate in expressive and unique ways, breaking the language barrier and providing a fun outlet for creative expression. We open the world to a whole new level of communication and storytelling; this time the author is you.
